        A node is a process that performs computation. Nodes are combined together
        and communicate with one another using streaming topics, RPC services, and
        the Parameter Server. These nodes are meant to operate at a fine-grained scale;
        a robot control system will usually comprise many nodes. For example, one node
        controls a laser range-finder, one Node controls the robot's wheel motors, one
        node performs localization, one node performs path planning, one node provides a
        graphical view of the system, and so on.
